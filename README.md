# Tracker Rewriter

I have a VDS and WIM station tracking db.  It doesn't really track
anything, that is a misnomer.  But it does keep track of everything I
know about these detectors, including the various timestamps when the
detectors were included in the published list from PeMS.

The core functionality of this module is to expose the couchdb and
views to an express web server.
